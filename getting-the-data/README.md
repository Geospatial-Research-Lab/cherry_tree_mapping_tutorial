# Getting the Data

In this tutorial, we will be using the Urban Forestry Administration's street tree data. The data is available [here](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/urban-forestry-street-trees) through the OpenDataDC web portal. Once you're on the dataset's website, click the download button and scroll down the page to select the GeoJSON option. Be sure to note where on your computer the file is saved.

Note: You can either choose to download an existing GeoJSON or have the website compile a new one. Either is fine, but creating the new file will take longer.&#x20;
