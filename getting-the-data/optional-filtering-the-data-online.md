# Optional: Filtering the Data Online

There are \~205,000 street trees in the dataset we're downloading. That can be a bit much to work with depending on your computer's processing speed and your internet connection. It is possible to filter the data on the Open Data DC portal before downloading.&#x20;

To filter the dataset, click on the Filter Data icon, then select the attribute you want to filter by. For this tutorial, filtering by GENUS\_NAME and then selecting PRUNUS as the value you want to retain is sufficient. Prunus, the genus of cherry trees makes up a little more than 6% of the dataset, so the number of rows of data is significantly decreased.

To export the filtered data, click on the Download icon, make sure you Toggle Filters to on, and then scroll down to select GeoJSON from the available filetypes. It may take a few minutes for your filtered dataset to finish downloading.
