# Adding Data to QGIS

Now we'll add our downloaded street tree data to QGIS. if you're a new QGIS user, it might be helpful to start with taking a quick tour of the graphical user interface (GUI). You'll find an [explanation of the parts of the GUI](https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/user\_manual/introduction/qgis\_gui.html) on the QGIS Documentation site.

Use the Data Source Manager to import the GeoJSON file you downloaded previously as a Vector filetype and click Add to add the layer to the map.

Depending on whether or not you're using the entire street trees dataset or a pre-filtered version, your data should look something like this. (This is pre-filtered data.)&#x20;

Note: QGIS randomly selects colors for visualizing data, so your data will likely be a different color.&#x20;
