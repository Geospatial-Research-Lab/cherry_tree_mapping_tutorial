# Getting the Data

In this tutorial, we will be using the Urban Forestry Administration's street tree data. The data is available through the OpenDataDC web portal. At the time of writing, the UFA Street Tree dataset contains \~205,000 rows of data. That can be a bit much to work with depending on your computer's processing speed and your internet connection. So, for this tutorial we'll use a subset of this data that we created in R.&#x20;

You can download the dataset for this tutorial here: \[Cherry Tree Data]\([https://github.com/Geospatial-Research-Lab/cherry\_tree\_map/blob/main/cherry\_trees.geojson](https://github.com/Geospatial-Research-Lab/cherry\_tree\_map/blob/main/cherry\_trees.geojson))

Note: If you're interested in learning how the filtered street tree dataset was created using R, you can find a tutorial outlining the process here: [Data Cleaning in R](https://app.gitbook.com/o/ThWvOcCRTMrwCZO55Bob/s/HSbaT4u9wHReAgJtBOGa/).
